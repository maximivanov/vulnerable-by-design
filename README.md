# Vulnerable by design

Security best practices for Node.js applications. 
Loosely based on (but not limited to) the 
[Node.js best practices](https://github.com/goldbergyoni/nodebestpractices#6-security-best-practices).

Each folder in this repo represents a best practice.

Each demonstrates a vulnerable mini-project with proposed solution in a pull request.

Each has a link to a blog post describing the best practice in detail:

```
Problem → Example attack → Solution → Implementation in Node.js → Implications
```
